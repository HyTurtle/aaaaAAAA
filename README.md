# Poetry

We decided to use poetry for this game. For those unfamiliar with poetry, [here's](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) a link to the docs!

Running `poetry install` in the projects root directory will install all dependencies
`poetry shell` will enter a shell
`poetry update` will update your poetry lock file if you added new dependencies

`poetry run task start` will start the game, equivilent to `python -m aaaaAAAA`

## CI
`poetry run task precommit` will install the pre-commit hook
`poetry run pre-commit` will run the pre-commit hook

`poetry run task lint` will lint all your code!
